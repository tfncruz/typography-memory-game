# TYPOGRAPHY MEMORY GAME

### Author
Tiago Cruz

### Description
Typography Memory Game was developed for the Udacity Front-End Nano Degree course (Google Scholarship). The goal was to develop a simple memory game and I choose the Typography theme.

There is no limit of time or moves to complete the game. Although to keep the three stars rating you should finish in less that 16 moves. After that the rating falls to two stars and, after 24 moves, to one star.

The goal is to finish with three stars in the short amount of time possible.

You have a reset button. *I'm feeling lucky* actually doesn't show you the solution or anything like that but makes you start all over againâ€¦

In the end, after you find all the eight pairs, the game will show you not just the stars rating but how much time you took to complete and how many moves you used for the task.

Developed in HTML/CSS and Javascript
